SEE ALSO: 7 of the best coffee grinders to maximize your morning Do you really want to spend hundreds of greenbacks on something that you can fix yourself, though? Why not unleash your inner handiness and mend it on your own? Not only will you get to save money, but you&amp;apos;ll also be filled with a sense of pride knowing that you fixed it yourself. The items below can help with DIY household repairs and are insanely easy to use — plus they&amp;apos;re all on sale.  Rust-Oleum® NeverWet® Liquid Repelling Treatment — 63% off If you have things around the house that you never want to be in contact with moisture (like water, mud, sauces, creams, any liquid really), this two-step spray system makes them repellent to all sorts of fluids. The process is fairly straightforward: Spray some of this magic stuff on the surface, wait 30 minutes, give it another coating, let it sit for half a day, and there you have it. You can use it on surfaces like metal, wood, PVC, and concrete to create a protective barrier. Maybe even your work boots if you want to keep them perpetually dry. Just remember not to spray it on gadgets, clothing, and yourself of course. Normally $59.94, you can snag a 3-pack now for $21.99.

Noticed a crack on your nightstand? You can easily fix any of the above with this magic wand, er pen. Designed to seal cracks, protect exposed wires, fill gaps, build layers, and bond objects together, this FiberFix Total Repair pen can pretty much restore anything. It acts as a glue and surface adhesive — all you need to do is give it a little squeeze and apply the specialized resin on the surface. To accelerate the cure time, shine the UV light, and the sealing will be done in seconds. You can even sand or paint over it if you wish. A two-pack usually retails for $40, but you can get it on sale today for $14.99.

FiberFix Repair Wrap is head and shoulders above that flimsy adhesive and is actually made to be 100 times stronger. If you have larger items that need mending — like a broken broom, a split pipe, or snapped garden tools — you don&amp;apos;t have to rush to the store to purchase a replacement. Roll up your sleeves, put on some gloves, dip FiberFix in water, stick it on the surface that needs repair, and do burpees for 10 minutes while you wait for it to dry. After that, you&amp;apos;ll have stronger abs and glutes, and your item will be good as new. Get a 3-pack now for $12.99, marked down from $18.99.

Why not unleash your inner handiness and mend it on your own? Not only will you get to save money, but you&amp;apos;ll also be filled with a sense of pride knowing that you fixed it yourself. The items below can help with DIY household repairs and are insanely easy to use — plus they&amp;apos;re all on sale.  Rust-Oleum® NeverWet® Liquid Repelling Treatment — 63% off If you have things around the house that you never want to be in contact with moisture (like water, mud, sauces, creams, any liquid really), this two-step spray system makes them repellent to all sorts of fluids. The process is fairly straightforward: Spray some of this magic stuff on the surface, wait 30 minutes, give it another coating, let it sit for half a day, and there you have it. You can use it on surfaces like metal, wood, PVC, and concrete to create a protective barrier. Maybe even your work boots if you want to keep them perpetually dry. Just remember not to spray it on gadgets, clothing, and yourself of course. Normally $59.94, you can snag a 3-pack now for $21.99.

Noticed a crack on your nightstand? You can easily fix any of the above with this magic wand, er pen. Designed to seal cracks, protect exposed wires, fill gaps, build layers, and bond objects together, this FiberFix Total Repair pen can pretty much restore anything. It acts as a glue and surface adhesive — all you need to do is give it a little squeeze and apply the specialized resin on the surface. To accelerate the cure time, shine the UV light, and the sealing will be done in seconds. You can even sand or paint over it if you wish. A two-pack usually retails for $40, but you can get it on sale today for $14.99.

FiberFix Repair Wrap is head and shoulders above that flimsy adhesive and is actually made to be 100 times stronger. If you have larger items that need mending — like a broken broom, a split pipe, or snapped garden tools — you don&amp;apos;t have to rush to the store to purchase a replacement. Roll up your sleeves, put on some gloves, dip FiberFix in water, stick it on the surface that needs repair, and do burpees for 10 minutes while you wait for it to dry. After that, you&amp;apos;ll have stronger abs and glutes, and your item will be good as new. Get a 3-pack now for $12.99, marked down from $18.99.

Sorry your girlfriend is too good for you, pal!      Sometimes you can joyfully watch an OP get torn to shreds in the comments, like this woman who won&amp;apos;t stand up against her hateful family.
